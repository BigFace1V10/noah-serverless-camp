## About Me
Hi there! I am Noah Zhang, currently a CS undergrad @ University of Southern California. Passionate about human-centered technology, I love to focus on projects and research that would benefit society. This summer, I am really excited to learn and utilize serverless technologies and cloud computing at Serverless Camp. Apart from coding, soccer, photography, and music are also indispensable parts of my life. A fun fact, I extremely love Oreo!
